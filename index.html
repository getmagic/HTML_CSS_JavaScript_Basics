    <center><h1>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics</h1>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all needed to make a website. HTML</strong> stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is the content and core of the website. This language practices a variety of <em> headings, paragraphs, pictures, videos. </em> <strong> CSS</strong> stands for <emp> Cascading Style Sheets. </emp> This language adds styling to the website and makes the website look more authentic. <strong>JavaScript </strong> allows interactivity and adds behavior. The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript.</p>
    <br></br>
  <h3><u>HTML</u></h3>
    <h4><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></h4>
    <p>HTML is the first step to making a website. This programming language is made up of many elements. These elements have opening and closing tags, along with content inside of the tags. Most syntax in html has "<____>" for opening tags, but for closing tags, the syntax usually has "/<____>". For some syntax, such as "img", there is no need for "</img>" as the code will only need an opening tag of "<img>" and a closing tag of "/>". </p></center>
    <p>Here is the list of basic commands in HTML </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Doctype: Defines a document </li>
      <li> html: Specifies which version of html you are using </li>
      <li> head: Defines information about the document </li>
      <li> title: Defines a title for the document </li>
      <li> body: All text that you want to display onscreen should be placed inside these brackets </li>
      <li> h1 through h6: Defines headings (h1 is the largest font size, and h6 is the smallest) </li>
      <li> p: Defines a paragraph (This is particularly placed under h1s and h6s) </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></h4>
    <p>CSS is the second step to making a website. You start CSS the same way that you would start HTML code. You would first define the document (using the syntax "Doctype"), and then you would specify which version of html you are using. But in CSS, you willl need an opening "style" tag placed underneath the opening "head" tag and a closing "style" tag placed above the closing "head" tag. If you want to style a heading, you place h1 in between the opening and closing "style" tags and after h1, place an opening and closing bracket "{" and "}". If you want to highlight the heading purple, place "background-color: purple;" between the two brackets. If you want a paragraph in a blue color, do the same thing you did for highlighting the color for the heading, except place a "p" instead of "h" (since you want to change the color of the paragraph and not the heading) and place "color: blue;" in between the brackets. </p></center>
    <p>Here is the list of basic commands in CSS </p>
    <ul>
      <li>all: Resets all properties</li>
      <li>background-color: Specifies the backgorund color of an element </li>
      <li>background-image: Specifies one or more background images for an element </li>
      <li>color: Sets color to a text </li>
      <li>cursor: Specifies the mouse to be displayed when pointing over an element </li>
      <li>font: Sets all the font properties in one declaration</li>
      <li>letter-spacing: Increases or decreases the spacing between characters in a text</li>
      <li>margin: Sets all the margin properties in one declaration</li>
      <li>width: Sets the width of the element</li>
    </ul>

<center><h3><u>JavaScript</u></h3>
  <p> One of the most popular coding languages, JavaScript creates interactivity for websites. JavaScript is, in no way, related to Java. JavaScript can fix layout issues. Using JavaScript, you can find the position and area of any element on the page, and the dimensions of the browser window. Additionally, JavaScript can be used to animate elements on a page. This programming lanugage also allows you to run different programs on a website. A very important thing is that JavaScript is case sensitive. Variables such as "a" and "A" are considered two different variables.</p></center>
  <p> Here is the list of basic syntax needed in JavaScript</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Text needs to be written in single or double quotes</li>
    <li>There are variables, which you use "var" to assign it to a specific value</li>
    <li>Use the equal sign "=" to assign a value to a variable</li>
    <li>Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to compute values</li>
  </ul>

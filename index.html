This language practices a variety of <em> headings, paragraphs, pictures, videos. </em> <strong> CSS</strong> stands for <emp> Cascading Style Sheets. </emp> This language adds styling to the website and makes the website look more authentic. <strong>JavaScript </strong> allows interactivity and adds behavior.

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <h4><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em></h4>
    <p>HTML is the first step to making a website. This programming language is made up of many elements. These elements have opening and closing tags, along with content inside of the tags. Most syntax in html has "<____>" for opening tags, but for closing tags, the syntax usually has "/<____>". For some syntax, such as "img", there is no need for "</img>" as the code will only need an opening tag of "<img>" and a closing tag of "/>". </p>
    <p>Here is the list of basic commands in HTML </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Doctype: Defines a document </li>
      <li> html: Specifies which version of html you are using </li>
      <li> head: Defines information about the document </li>
      <li> title: Defines a title for the document </li>
      <li> body: All text that you want to display onscreen should be placed inside these brackets </li>
      <li> h1 through h6: Defines headings (h1 is the largest font size, and h6 is the smallest) </li>
      <li> p: Defines a paragraph (This is particularly placed under h1s and h6s) </li>
    </ol>
    <p>A sample of how HTML code would look like:</p>
